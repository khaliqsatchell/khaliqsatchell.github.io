<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to the personal website of Khaliq Satchell.</p>
<p>I am currently a senior attending Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, NC. I am originally 
from Columbia, MD but decided to attend college in the south because I knew people in the area.</p>
<p>While attending ECSU, I participated in a research program on campus called the Center of Excellence 
in Remote Sensing Education and Research (CERSER). I was a part of CERSER for three years and it provided 
me with research opportunities as well as a scholarship. In CERSER, I was involved in two Spring research projects
that involved remote sensing. The first project was research involving the GOES data satalites and my 
second research had me out in the field using unmanned aerial vehicles to survey archaeological sites.</p>
<p>During the Summer of 2014, I went to Indiana University in Bloomington and worked with Bioinformatic 
software but I was tasked with improving it. For the Summer of 2016, I had an internship at Apple, Inc. in Cupertino, CA. 
I was able to intern there due to me being an Apple HBCU Scholar which not only gave me an internship but also gave me a
scholarship that paid for my Senior year of college.</p>
<p>I am a very ambitious, hard-working student who wants to help innovate the world. When I set my mind to it,
I follow through no matter how tough the task gets because I have a drive to achieve.</div>

<div id="container">Welcome to the personal website of Khaliq Satchell (That's me). I am currently a senior attending
Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, NC. I am originally from Columbia, MD but decided to 
attend college in the south because I knew people in the area. 
<p>While attending ECSU, I participated in a research program on campus called the Center of Excellence 
in Remote Sensing Education and Research (CERSER). In CERSER, I was involved in two Spring research projects
that involved remote sensing. The first project was research involving the GOES data satalites and my 
second research had me out in the field using unmanned aerial vehicles to survey archaeological sites.</p>
<p>During the Summer of 2014, I went to Indiana University in Bloomington and worked with Bioinformatic 
software. For the Summer of 2016, I had an internship at Apple, Inc. in Cupertino, CA. I was able to intern
there due to me being an Apple HBCU Scholar which not only gave me an internship but also gave me a
scholarship that paid for my Senior year of college.</p>
<p>I am a very ambitious, hard-working student who wants to help innovate the world.</div>
